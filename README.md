# Hey, I'm Dhyey Sanghvi!

Welcome to my GitHub. This space is a mix of things I break, build, and iterate onâ€”sometimes for work, sometimes for fun, and often just to see what happens.

## Why Are You Here?
- You're in tech, and you like seeing how others solve problems.
- You're a recruiter, and you're looking for someone who codes like they mean it.
- You accidentally clicked a link and are now mildly curious. Stick around.

## What You'll Find
- Code that aims to be elegant but isn't afraid to be pragmatic.
- Projects spanning AI, security, automation, and anything else that piques my interest.
- A relentless attempt to balance performance, scalability, and readability.

## Let's Talk
Curious about something? Want to build something cool? Just want to chat tech?
